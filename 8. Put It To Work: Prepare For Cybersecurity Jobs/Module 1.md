## Disaster Recovery Plan

A disaster recovery plan allows an organizationâ€™s security team to outline the steps needed to minimize the impact of a security incident, such as a successful ransomware attack that prevents the manufacturing team from retrieving certain data. It also helps the security team resolve the security threat. 

A disaster recovery plan is typically created alongside a business continuity plan. Steps to create a disaster recovery plan should include:

- **Implementing recovery strategies to restore software**
- **Implementing recovery strategies to restore hardware functionality**
- **Identifying applications and data that might be impacted after a security incident**


# Business Continuity Plan

The impact of successful security attacks on an organization can be significant. Loss of profits and customers are two possible outcomes that organizations never want to happen. A **business continuity plan** is a document that outlines the procedures to sustain business operations during and after a significant disruption. It is created alongside a disaster recovery plan to minimize the damage of a successful security attack.

Here are four essential steps for business continuity plans:

1. **Conduct a business impact analysis**  
   The business impact analysis focuses on the possible effects a disruption of business functions can have on an organization.

2. **Identify, document, and implement steps to recover critical business functions and processes**  
   This step helps the business continuity team create actionable steps toward responding to a security event.

3. **Organize a business continuity team**  
   This step brings various members of the organization together to help execute the business continuity plan if needed. The team typically includes members from cybersecurity, IT, HR, communications, and operations departments.

4. **Conduct training for the business continuity team**  
   The team considers different risk scenarios and prepares for security threats during training exercises.
