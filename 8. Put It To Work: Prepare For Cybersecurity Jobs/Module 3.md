# Who Are Stakeholders?

A **stakeholder** is defined as an individual or group that has an interest in any decision or activity of an organization. As a security analyst, a significant part of your role will involve reporting your findings to various security stakeholders.

## Levels of Stakeholders

Within larger organizations, there are many levels of stakeholders. As an entry-level analyst, you may only communicate directly with a few of them. However, it's important to have an understanding of who the key stakeholders are:

- **Cybersecurity Risk Manager**  
  A professional responsible for leading efforts to identify, assess, and mitigate security risks within an organization.

- **Chief Executive Officer (CEO)**  
  The highest-ranking person in an organization. As an entry-level analyst, you are unlikely to communicate directly with this stakeholder.

- **Chief Financial Officer (CFO)**  
  Another high-level stakeholder that you're unlikely to communicate with directly.

- **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**  
  The highest level of security stakeholder. Like the CEO and CFO, you are unlikely to communicate directly with this stakeholder as an entry-level analyst.

- **Operations Manager**  
  Oversees the day-to-day security operations. These individuals lead teams involved in the development and implementation of security strategies that protect an organization from cyber threats.

## Stakeholder Focus

- **CFOs** and **CISOs** are generally focused on the big picture, such as the potential financial impact of a security incident.
- **Operations Managers**, on the other hand, are more concerned with the immediate impact on day-to-day operations.
