## Summary of Network Protocols

Network protocols are sets of rules that govern how devices communicate over a network. They define how data is formatted, transmitted, received, and interpreted.  Here's a summary of some key protocols:

### Application Layer (User-Facing)

*   **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** The foundation of the World Wide Web. Used for transferring web pages and other content.  `https://` adds a layer of security (SSL/TLS).
*   **HTTPS (HTTP Secure):** Encrypted version of HTTP, using SSL/TLS for secure communication.
*   **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Used for sending email.
*   **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):** Used for retrieving email.
*   **POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3):** Another protocol for retrieving email.
*   **DNS (Domain Name System):** Translates domain names (e.g., google.com) to IP addresses.
*   **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Used for transferring files between computers.
*   **SSH (Secure Shell):** Provides secure remote access to a computer.

### Transport Layer (End-to-End)

*   **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data. Used when data integrity is crucial.
*   **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Provides a connectionless, unreliable delivery of data.  Faster, but doesn't guarantee delivery or order. Used when speed is more important than accuracy (e.g., streaming).

### Network Layer (Routing)

*   **IP (Internet Protocol):** Responsible for addressing and routing packets across networks. Defines IP addresses and how packets are forwarded.
*   **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):** Used for error reporting and network diagnostics (e.g., `ping`).

### Link Layer (Local Network)

*   **Ethernet:** A common standard for wired local area networks (LANs).
*   **Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11):** A standard for wireless LANs.
*   **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** Translates IP addresses to MAC addresses (used within a local network).

### Other Important Protocols

*   **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.
*   **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** Creates a secure connection over a public network (like the internet).
*   **TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer):** Cryptographic protocols that provide secure communication over a network.  Used by HTTPS.

This is not an exhaustive list, but it covers many of the most commonly used network protocols.  Understanding these protocols is essential for anyone working in networking or cybersecurity.
