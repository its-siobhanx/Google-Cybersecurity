## Key Cybersecurity Terminology

This section defines key terms related to cybersecurity.

*   **Compliance:** The process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations, enabling organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.

*   **Security Frameworks:** Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.

*   **Security Controls:** Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.

*   **Security Posture:** An organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.

*   **Threat Actor (Malicious Attacker):** Any person or group who presents a security risk. This risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data.

*   **Internal Threat:** A current or former employee, an external vendor, or a trusted partner who poses a security risk. Internal threats can be accidental (e.g., an employee clicking on a malicious email link) or intentional (e.g., unauthorized data access).

*   **Network Security:** The practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. This includes data, services, systems, and devices stored in an organization’s network.

*   **Cloud Security:** The process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured (set up correctly) and access to those assets is limited to authorized users. The cloud is a network made up of a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote physical locations known as data centers, accessible via the internet. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.

*   **Programming (in a Cybersecurity Context):** A process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks relevant to cybersecurity, such as:
    *   Automation of repetitive tasks (e.g., searching a list of malicious domains)
    *   Reviewing web traffic
    *   Alerting suspicious activity
