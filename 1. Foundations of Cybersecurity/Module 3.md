## The CIA Triad, Security Frameworks, and Compliance

The Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad is a fundamental model in cybersecurity, guiding organizations in risk assessment and security policy development.  It represents three core principles used to establish security controls that mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

*   **Confidentiality:**  Ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized individuals.
*   **Integrity:**  Maintaining the accuracy and trustworthiness of data, preventing unauthorized modification.
*   **Availability:**  Guaranteeing reliable access to information and systems when needed.

Security controls are safeguards implemented to reduce specific security risks. They work in conjunction with security frameworks to ensure security goals are met, processes are effective, and organizations achieve regulatory compliance.

Security frameworks provide guidelines for building risk mitigation plans for data and privacy. They typically include four core components:

1.  Identifying and documenting security goals
2.  Setting guidelines to achieve those goals
3.  Implementing robust security processes
4.  Monitoring and communicating results

Compliance is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) develops voluntary compliance frameworks, like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF), that organizations worldwide use to manage risk.  Greater alignment with compliance frameworks generally correlates with lower organizational risk.
