## Common Cybersecurity Attacks

This section describes common cybersecurity attack methods.

### Phishing

Phishing uses digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.  Common types include:

*   **Business Email Compromise (BEC):** An email seemingly from a known source requests information or actions for financial gain.
*   **Spear Phishing:** A targeted attack against a specific user or group, appearing to originate from a trusted source.
*   **Whaling:** Spear phishing targeting high-level executives for sensitive data access.
*   **Vishing:** Exploiting voice communication to obtain sensitive information or impersonate a known source.
*   **Smishing:** Using text messages to trick users into revealing information or impersonating a known source.

### Malware

Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks, often for financial gain or intelligence advantages. Common types include:

*   **Viruses:** Malicious code that interferes with computer operations and damages data/software. Requires user initiation (e.g., opening a malicious attachment).
*   **Worms:** Self-replicating malware that spreads across systems without user interaction.
*   **Ransomware:** Encrypts an organization's data and demands payment for its restoration.
*   **Spyware:** Gathers and sells information without consent, often accessing devices to collect personal data.

### Social Engineering

Social engineering manipulates human behavior to gain private information, access, or valuables by exploiting trust and human error. Common types include:

*   **Social Media Phishing:** Gathering target information from social media and using it in an attack.
*   **Watering Hole Attack:** Targeting a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.
*   **USB Baiting:** Leaving malware-infected USB drives for employees to find and use.
*   **Physical Social Engineering:** Impersonating someone to gain unauthorized physical access.

### Social Engineering Principles

Social engineering is effective because people are often trusting and respect authority.  Key principles exploited include:

*   **Authority:** Impersonating powerful individuals.
*   **Intimidation:** Using bullying tactics.
*   **Consensus/Social Proof:** Implying that many others are doing something.
*   **Scarcity:** Implying limited supply of goods or services.
*   **Familiarity:** Establishing a fake emotional connection.
*   **Trust:** Building a relationship to gain trust and information.
*   **Urgency:** Pressuring for quick action without questioning.
