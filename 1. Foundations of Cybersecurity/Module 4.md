## Cybersecurity Toolkits and Playbooks

This section describes key tools and documentation used in cybersecurity.

### SIEM Tools

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools collect and analyze log data (records of system events) to monitor critical organizational activities. SIEMs reduce analyst workload by providing alerts for specific threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.  They offer visual dashboards for data organization and analysis, with various hosting options (on-premise, cloud). Cloud-hosted SIEMs are often easier to set up and maintain, making them suitable for less experienced security teams.

### Network Protocol Analyzers (Packet Sniffers)

Network protocol analyzers (packet sniffers) capture and analyze network traffic data. They record all data encountered by computers within an organization's network.

### Playbooks

Playbooks are manuals detailing operational actions, such as incident response procedures. Organizations use multiple playbooks to document processes and procedures for their teams. Playbooks guide analysts through specific security-related tasks.

**Example Scenario: Incident Response**

Imagine working as a security analyst for an incident response firm. You're investigating a security breach at a small medical practice. Your role is to assist with the forensic investigation and provide evidence to a cybersecurity insurance company.

Playbooks would outline the necessary steps for the investigation. Two key playbooks you might consult are:

1.  **Chain of Custody Playbook:** Documents evidence possession and control during an incident lifecycle. This includes documenting who, what, where, and why evidence was collected, ensuring its safety and tracking its movement.  Every evidence transfer must be reported.

2.  **Protecting and Preserving Evidence Playbook:** Guides handling fragile and volatile digital evidence.  This involves understanding the *order of volatility* (the sequence for preserving data, prioritizing volatile data that may be lost if a device is powered off).  Proper evidence handling is crucial, as improper management can compromise evidence and render it unusable.  Data preservation typically involves making copies and analyzing those copies to avoid altering the original evidence.
