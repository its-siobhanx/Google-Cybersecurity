## Cybersecurity Toolkits and Playbooks

This section describes key tools and documentation used in cybersecurity.

### SIEM Tools

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools collect and analyze log data (records of system events) to monitor critical organizational activities. SIEMs reduce analyst workload by providing alerts for specific threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.  They offer visual dashboards for data organization and analysis, with various hosting options (on-premise, cloud). Cloud-hosted SIEMs are often easier to set up and maintain, making them suitable for less experienced security teams.

### Network Protocol Analyzers (Packet Sniffers)

Network protocol analyzers (packet sniffers) capture and analyze network traffic data. They record all data encountered by computers within an organization's network.

### Playbooks

Playbooks are manuals detailing operational actions, such as incident response procedures. Organizations use multiple playbooks to document processes and procedures for their teams. Playbooks guide analysts through specific security-related tasks.
