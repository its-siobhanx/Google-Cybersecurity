## Audit Checklist

Creating an audit checklist is essential before conducting any audit.  A typical checklist focuses on the following areas:

### 1. Identify the Scope of the Audit

The audit scope should:

*   List the assets to be assessed (e.g., firewall configurations, PII security, physical security of assets).
*   Explain how the audit will help the organization achieve its goals.
*   Define the frequency of audits.
*   Evaluate organizational policies, protocols, and procedures to ensure effectiveness and employee implementation.

### 2. Complete a Risk Assessment

A risk assessment evaluates identified organizational risks related to:

*   Budget
*   Controls
*   Internal processes
*   External standards (e.g., regulations)

### 3. Conduct the Audit

During an internal audit, assess the security of the assets identified in the audit scope.

### 4. Create a Mitigation Plan

A mitigation plan outlines strategies to reduce risk and potential costs, penalties, or other negative impacts on the organization's security posture.

### 5. Communicate Results to Stakeholders

The audit process culminates in a detailed report including:

*   Findings
*   Suggested improvements to reduce organizational risk
*   Relevant compliance regulations and standards
