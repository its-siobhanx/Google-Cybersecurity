## The CIA Triad for Analysts

The CIA triad is a model that guides organizations in considering risk when establishing systems and security policies. It comprises three elements that cybersecurity analysts and organizations strive to uphold: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Maintaining an acceptable risk level and designing systems and policies with these elements in mind contributes to a successful security posture—an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change.

### Confidentiality

Confidentiality ensures that only authorized users can access specific assets or data. Organizations can enhance confidentiality by implementing design principles like the principle of least privilege. This principle limits users' access to only the information necessary to complete work-related tasks, thus maintaining the confidentiality and security of private data.

### Integrity

Integrity ensures that data is verifiably correct, authentic, and reliable. Protocols to verify data authenticity are essential. Cryptography is one method used to transform data, preventing unauthorized parties from reading or tampering with it (NIST, 2022). Encryption, the process of converting data from a readable to an encoded format, is another example. Encryption can prevent access and ensure data integrity, such as messages on an organization's internal chat platform.

### Availability

Availability ensures that data is accessible to authorized users when needed. When a system adheres to both availability and confidentiality principles, data can be used as required.  For example, an organization might allow remote employees access to its internal network, with access levels tailored to individual job requirements.  An accounting department employee might access corporate accounts but not data related to ongoing development projects.

## OWASP Principles

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit foundation dedicated to improving software security.  While OWASP doesn't have a formal, numbered list of "principles," their work and best practices suggest the following core concepts for secure web application development:

1.  **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security controls. If one layer fails, others provide continued protection. Don't rely on a single point of defense.

2.  **Fail Securely:** Design systems to default to a secure state upon failure. For example, if authentication fails, deny access. Avoid "failing open."

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users and processes only the minimum necessary permissions. This limits potential damage from errors or malicious activity.

4.  **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, well-understood designs over complex ones. Complexity can introduce hard-to-find and manage vulnerabilities.

5.  **Economy of Mechanism:** Keep the number of security mechanisms small and simple to reduce the attack surface and ease verification.

6.  **Open Design:** While not always strictly followed, OWASP generally advocates for open design and peer review of security mechanisms (not sensitive implementation details, but rather transparent security designs and principles).

7.  **Least Common Mechanism:** Avoid sharing security mechanisms between users or processes unless absolutely necessary. Shared mechanisms can create vulnerabilities if one user or process is compromised.

8.  **Psychological Acceptability:** Security mechanisms should be easy to use and not interfere with legitimate work. Cumbersome security leads to workarounds.

9.  **Work Factor:** Make the cost of attacking a system higher than the potential benefit to the attacker. Use strong cryptography, robust authentication, and other measures.

10. **Compromise Recording:** Implement mechanisms to detect and record security breaches for timely response and prevention of future attacks (often tied to logging and monitoring).

These principles, while not exhaustive, represent core values and best practices promoted by OWASP for building secure web applications and mitigating risks highlighted in the OWASP Top Ten and other resources. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
