# Logs and Analysis

**Types of logs**
Depending on the data source, different log types can be produced. Here’s a list of some common log types that organizations should record:
* Network: Network logs are generated by network devices like firewalls, routers, or switches.
* System: System logs are generated by operating systems like Chrome OS™, Windows, Linux, or macOS®. 
* Application: Application logs are generated by software applications and contain information relating to the events occurring within the application such as a smartphone app.
* Security: Security logs are generated by various devices or systems such as antivirus software and intrusion detection systems. Security logs contain security-related information such as file deletion.
* Authentication: Authentication logs are generated whenever authentication occurs such as a successful login attempt into a computer.

## Suricata
[Suricata](https://suricata.io/) is an open-source intrusion detection system, intrusion prevention system, and network analysis tool.

Suricata has three main uses:
1. **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: Suricata monitors network traffic to detect and alert on suspicious activities and intrusions. It can also be configured as a host-based IDS to track system and network activities on individual hosts.
2. **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**: Suricata can detect and block malicious activity and traffic when configured as an IPS, which requires additional setup to enable IPS mode.
3. **Network Security Monitoring (NSM)**: Suricata helps safeguard networks by generating and storing network logs. It analyzes live traffic, packet capture files, and creates packet captures for forensics, incident response, and testing signatures, such as capturing live traffic to refine detection signatures.
