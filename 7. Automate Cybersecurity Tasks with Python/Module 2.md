# Functions
A function is a section of code that can be reused in a program. Functions are important in Python because they allow you to automate repetitive parts of your code.

* The def keyword is placed before a function name to define a function.
* The brackets that follow the name of the function and the colon (:) at the end of the function header are also essential parts of the syntax.
* Pro tip: When naming a function, give it a name that indicates what it does. This will make it easier to remember when calling it later.
* The body of the function is an indented block of code after the function header that defines what the function does. The indentation is very important when writing a function because it separates the definition of a function from the rest of the code.
* After defining a function, you can use it as many times as needed in your code. Using a function after defining it is referred to as calling a function. To call a function, write its name followed by brackets.
* Calling a function inside of the body of its function definition can create an infinite loop. This happens when it is not combined with logic that stops the function call when certain conditions are met.
* When defining functions in Python, you use return statements if you want the function to return output. The return keyword is used to return information from a function.
* The return keyword appears in front of the information that you want to return.

## Built in functions
* print() - outputs a specified object to the screen.
* The type() function returns the data type of its argument. The type() function helps you keep track of the data types of variables to avoid errors throughout your code.
* When working with functions, you often need to pass them through print() if you want to output the data type to the screen. This is the case when using a function like type().
* The max() function returns the largest numeric input passed into it. The min() function returns the smallest numeric input passed into it.
* The sorted() function sorts the components of a list. The sorted() function also works on any iterable, like a string, and returns the sorted elements in a list. By default, it sorts them in ascending order. When given an iterable that contains numbers, it sorts them from smallest to largest; this includes iterables that contain numeric data as well as iterables that contain string data beginning with numbers. An iterable that contains strings that begin with alphabetic characters will be sorted alphabetically.
