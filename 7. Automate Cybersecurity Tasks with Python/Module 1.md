# Python

### Comments in Python
Useful for explaining what a section of code does and helping to make code more readable etc
* Use hashtag for a comment #

### Print function
Useful for displaying information to the screen
* Use print("")

### Data types
* **String:** Characters in a string may include letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces. These characters must be placed within quotation marks. Can use either double or single quoatation marks but ensure to keep consistency whatever you choose.
* **List:** Lists elements can be of any data type, such as strings, integers, Booleans, or even other lists. The elements of a list are placed within square brackets, and each element is separated by a comma.
* **Integer:** integer data is data consisting of a number that does not include a decimal point.
* **Float:** Float data is data consisting of a number with a decimal point.
* **Boolean:** Boolean data is data that can only be one of two values: either True or False.
* **Tuple:** Tuple data is a data structure that consists of a collection of data that cannot be changed. Like lists, tuples can contain elements of varying data types. A difference between tuple data and list data is that it is possible to change the elements in a list, but it is not possible to change the elements in a tuple
* **Dictionary:** Dictionary data is data that consists of one or more key-value pairs. Each key is mapped to a value. A colon (:) is placed between the key and value. Commas separate key-value pairs from other key-value pairs, and the dictionary is placed within curly brackets ({}).

You can use type() to get the variable type.

## Variables 
In a programming language, a variable is a container that stores data. It's a named storage location in a computer's memory that can hold a value. It stores the data in a particular data type, such as integer, string, or Boolean. The value that is stored in a variable can change. 

* **EXAMPLE** username = "Siobhan"
* Give the variable a name and use the = sign to give a value.
* Can reassign a variable value later on in the code
* Can assign one variable to another variable
* Use only letters, numbers, and underscores in variable names. Valid examples: date_3, username, interval2
* Remember that variable names in Python are case-sensitive.
* Don't use Pythonâ€™s built-in keywords or functions for variable names.
